Today, one billion people are 60 years or older.
That’s 12% of the entire world population, and the age group is growing
faster than any other group. Yet, online, the needs of older adults are
often overlooked or omitted. So what do we need to consider to make our
designs more inclusive for older adults? Well, let’s take a closer look.

This article is part of our ongoing series on [design patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/design-patterns). It’s also a part of the video library on [Smart Interface Design Patterns](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/) 🍣 and is available in the [live UX training](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops/interface-design-course-vitaly-friedman-spring/) as well.

## Make Users Feel Independent And Competent [#](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/guide-designing-older-adults/#make-users-feel-independent-and-competent)

When
designing for older adults, we shouldn’t make our design decisions
based on stereotypes or assumptions that are often not true at all.
Don’t assume that older adults struggle to use digital. Most users are
healthy, active, and have a solid income.

Older adults need large tap areas for better precision, but everyone can benefit from it. (Image source: “[How To Write Better Microcopy For Older Adults](https://uxdesign.cc/golden-microcopy-helping-older-users-use-your-product-f0f1b173aa3e)”) ([Large preview](https://files.smashing.media/articles/guide-designing-older-adults/1-designing-older-adults.png))

They might use the web differently than younger users, but that doesn’t mean we need to design a “barebones” version for them. What we need is a reliable, inclusive digital experience that helps everyone feel independent and competent.

Good accessibility is good for everyone. To make it happen, we need to bring older adults into our design process and find out what their needs are. This doesn’t only benefit the older audience but improves the overall UX — for everyone.

## One Task At A Time and Error Messages [#](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/guide-designing-older-adults/#one-task-at-a-time-and-error-messages)

When designing for older users, keep in mind that there are significant differences in age groups 60–65, 65–70, 70–75, and so on, so explore design decisions for each group individually.

Older adults often read and analyze every word (so-called Stroop effect),
so give them enough time to achieve a task, as well as control the
process. So avoid disappearing messages so that users can close them
themselves when they are ready or present only 1 question at a time in a
form.
