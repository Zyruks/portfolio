## HTML: The Structure of the Web

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of a webpage and its content. HTML elements are the building blocks of the web, allowing developers to structure text, links, images, and other content.

## CSS: Styling the Web

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS enables developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of a web page, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

## JavaScript: Bringing the Web to Life

JavaScript is a programming language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web content. It enables functionalities such as form validation, interactive maps, and dynamic content updates without needing to reload the page.
